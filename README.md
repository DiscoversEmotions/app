## What is this ?

REMEMBER is as interactive experiment aiming to provoke and question us about our own choices.  
Our project's main goal have been to make us understand the link between emotions and memories; and figure out the unique way that they are interconnected through the adventure of a protagonist that goes to reconquer his own lost emotions in a mysterious world, collecting little by little pieces from his past.  
That experiment has been made in webGL to make the experiment the most immersive possible.
This project is the result of 2 months worth of work, produced as a school project at Gobelins, l'Ã‰cole de l'Image
